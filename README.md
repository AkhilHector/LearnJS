# LearnJS

##### Ok, so what is this ?

> `LearnJs` is an attempt to portray the best parts of Javasript that are
pretty tough and hard to find. It is to be noted that this is not a book/guide
in any form, but a congregation of best practices, language constructs, and other
simple yet effective snippets that gives us an essence of how we can harness
the best out of the language.

##### Oh snoop, that piece of code isn't right !

Although the best of efforts have been put in to make sure the
entire documentation is error free there might be small instances where mistakes
might have occurred. In such cases please raise an issue and help me make this
cheat sheet better.

##### So what are all covered in the cheatsheet ?

- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Declarations
- Functions
- Conventions
- Closures
- Currying
